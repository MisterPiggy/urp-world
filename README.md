# urp-world

URP World is a project that will have some demo cases and also small full games on it.
I will try to keep this project always up to date with the latest Unity released version.

**Goals**

* Have simple ready game demos to play and test.
* Materials available for talks and tests.
* Assets that are free and can be used by different teams/developers.

**Game - Hold Grounds**

First game is called "Hold Grounds" and it is a mix of RTS with Tower Defense.
The game is complete (game loop) and I even created a way to do localization for games.

A small (but full) game where you need to reach the enemy flag and not lose morale.
Your units will have to destroy units and buildings in their way.
Assets are created to make it easy for anyone that wants to create more levels.

It can be played already in English, Portuguese and Spanish. To add more, just need to translate and change a few lines in Editor.

**Features**

* MonoBehaviour game objects
* Animation (and Animation Events)
* Animator
* Input system

**Plus**
