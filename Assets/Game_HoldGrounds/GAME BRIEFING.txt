==================== THE GAME ====================
Tower Defense (kinda) with base building.

Main goal:
- Reach the enemy base with any Unit to win.
- Destroy enemy units and buildings along the way.
- If you lose all your morale, you lose the game.
- If enemy reaches your flag, you lose the game.
- Score and upgrades are saved.

Gameplay:
- Your flag defines the radius where you can build.
- Build farms to collect gold.
    - Farms near trees generates more gold.
- Build Barracks to create warrior units.
    - Warriors are weak, but have good defense and speed.
- Build tower defenses to protect from attacks. You can also create archers from the tower.
    - Archers have good damage, low defense and speed is ok.
- Build Magic Towers to create wizards, it also fires a magic ball to close enemies.
    - Wizards are strong units, but lacks defense and speed.
- All units have 2 modes: attack or defend.
    - The order is global, all units will obey the same order.
    - When attacking, they will go the nearest enemy, always.
    - When defending, they will stop at nearest ally building while returning to the flag.
    - Enemy is always in attack mode.
- Each unit lost makes you lose 1 Morale Point.
    - If you lose all morale, you lose the level.
    - If an enemy unit reaches your flag, you also lose the level.
- Enemy will spawn unit waves from times to times, be ready. Wave timer is displayed.
- Enemy will also train units from a given time, not displayed in UI (some challenges and surprises for the player).
- Each unit destroyed (character or building) gives you 1 score point.
- The game will keep track of wins, loses and score.
- Many options can be customized at the GameManager prefab and scriptable objects.
