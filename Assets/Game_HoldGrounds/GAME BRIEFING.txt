===== THE GAME =====
Tower Defense (kinda) with base building.

Main goal:
- Destroy the enemy base to win the level.
- Score and upgrades are saved.

Gameplay:
- Your flag defines the radius where you can build.
- Build farms to collect gold. Farms near trees generates more gold.
- Build Barracks to create warrior units.
- Build Magic Towers to create wizards, it also fires a magic ball to close enemies.
- Build tower defenses to protect from attacks. You can also create archers from that.
- Each unit has 2 modes: attack or defend.
    - They will attack nearest enemy always.
    - They will defend the nearest ally building while returning to the flag.
- Each unit lost makes you lose Morale. If you lose all morale, you lose the level.
- Use your units to attack enemy outposts. Cleared outposts enables you new flags (more area to build).
- Destroy their base to win the level.
- Each completed level, gives you Gold to upgrade units.
- Upgrades are saved per game, so you can use those in any level.
- The game will keep track of wins, loses and score.

===== UPDATES =====

- Always keep up-to-date with latest Unity version (LTS preferable).
- Maybe add VR support.
- Add mobile support.
- Add console support.
